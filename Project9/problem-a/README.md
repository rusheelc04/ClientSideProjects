# Problem: Music Search (AJAX)

## Running the Program
Because this app is created with React (and scaffolded through [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)), you will need to install dependencies and run a developer web server in order to transpile and view the application. You can run this server by using the command:

```bash
# change directory to problem folder (this directory)
cd path/to/problem

# install dependencies
npm install  # only once

# run the server
npm start
```

You can then view the rendered page _in a web browser_. Remember to check the Developer console for any errors!
