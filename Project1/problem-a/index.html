    <p>
        Iron Man in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> (MCU) is portrayed as a charismatic,
        extremely intelligent and rich industrialist named Tony Stark. He is a genius inventor who becomes a superhero after building a suit of advanced armor
        integrated with a super AI to escape captivity. The character is known for his witty humor, high-tech gadgets, and being one of the founding members of
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)">Avengers</a>. His armor is red and gold, equipped with repulsor rays,
        flight capabilities, and an array of advanced technologies.  He is played by Robert Downey Jr., who brings a unique charm and depth to the character.

        <li>Personal growth: His path from a self-centered industrialist to a selfless hero who eventually sacrifices himself for the survival of half the universe highlights his personal development.</li>
        <li>Leadership: Stark was a great leader, especially within the Avengers.</li>
